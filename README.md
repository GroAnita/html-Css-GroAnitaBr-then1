# **Rainydays**
A front-end project built with HTML and CSS

### **📌 Project Description**

RainyDays is a fictional outdoor jacket brand created as part of my first-semester project at Noroff.
The goal of this assignment was to practice fundamental front-end skills by planning, designing, and building a responsive website using only HTML and CSS.

The website presents the brand, highlights jacket products, and includes a home page, product listings, and a contact page.
This project reflects my early design thinking, visual styling, and web structure knowledge.

* Understand basic accessibility principles

* Structure a multi-page website

* Design for both mobile and desktop

### **🛠️ Technologies Used**
